# ProjectOne

Welcome to my Tower defense game. The game is built using javascript, node.js, and Phaser for all the physics and hit detection.

##Game Instructions

After cloning the repo you need NPM install to get the server up then NPM start to run the game. If you go to localhost:8080 you should be able to play! To start the game you click the big blue button on the upper right hand side. This will spawn pandas and let you click the screen to place towers. Beware some spots you can't place towers! You get points for each panda destroyed and the game ends when the pandas finish the maze and enter your village.

##Future Version Ideas

First order of business is to add to a server running on my laptop to save everyones high score! I would really like all of my friends to compete against each other. I would like to add health to the enemies, range to the tower, and different types of enemies and towers. Perhaps give the player some type of currency to buy towers.
